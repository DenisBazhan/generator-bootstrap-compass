## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Yeoman Generators
This generator creates folder structure to work with Compass and Bootstrap. Also creates Gruntfile with such tasks as "Compile Sass/Compass" and "LiveReload"

To install generator-bootstrap-compass from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-bootstrap-compass
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash

```
